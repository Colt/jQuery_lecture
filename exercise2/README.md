#Image Slider Exercise

You're going to build a simple image slider using the images I've provided.  Write all your code inside of the provided `script.js` file.

##Part 1 - Automatic
Write Javascript code that will display 1 image a time for 3 seconds before automatically switching to the next image.  Make sure your code doesn't break when you hit the end of the array!  It should loop back to the first image.

##Part 2 - User Controlled
Add 2 buttons that the user can click to either view the next or previous image.

**Harder Version** Instead of clicking a 'next' or 'back' button to change images, the user can click on the right or left side of an image.

##Part 3 - Style
Make it look nice and use animations!
