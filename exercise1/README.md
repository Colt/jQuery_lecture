#jQuery Todo App

We're going to rewrite the simple todo list app from a few days ago.  Instead of using plain old vanilla JS to manipulate the DOM, we're going to use jQuery. I don't want to see any `document.someMethodCall`'s in your code.

When a user clicks on the button, your code should grab the text in the input and append a new todo list item to the ul. Don't forget to clear the input!  Look for a way to do this using jQuery.

**Bonus** When a user clicks on a specific todo item, it should change color.  If a user clicks on it again, it should fade out and disappear.
